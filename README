Testing:
For testing we first wrote small functions designed to stress
the various functions as we implemented them. In order to confirm
proper function, we added debugging statements throughout the
program and checked the values were as expected throughout
execution. After completing this, we then launched the provided
console and shells. From these we ran each of the remaining provided
tests.
