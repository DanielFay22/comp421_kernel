Our Kernel uses several files:

yalnix.c                   - contains KernelStart
kernel.h 				   - contains global variables, struct definitions
kernel_calls.c             - contains the kernel call functions
context_switch_functions.c - contains our context switch helper functions
interrupt_handlers.c 	   - contains the trap/interrupt handler routines
util.c 					   - contains utility methods such as linked list
load.c 					   - contains LoadProgram
idle.c 					   - idle user program to be loaded

Testing:
For testing we first wrote small functions designed to stress
the various functions as we implemented them. In order to confirm
proper function, we added debugging statements throughout the
program and checked the values were as expected throughout
execution. After completing this, we then launched the provided
console and shells. From these we ran each of the remaining provided
tests.
